# Crework Frontend Intern Assignment 

This was a frontend User interface assignment given to me by the Crework hiring team. I used Tailwind CSS and Reactjs for building UI. 
And added the required functionality and made it mobile-responsive with the help of mobile first approach. 

## Functionality and features
